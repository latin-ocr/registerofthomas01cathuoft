38 THE REGISTER OF BISHOP BRANTYNGHAM.

A-D· DEAN-Pmon [Dene, MS} V·

1375.

Vol, William Torre, priest, was inst. at this time. But fol. 35 has been cut out, and
[Ι. only the beginning of this Entry remains. On the 23rd of June the Bishop
{ffb (at East Horsley) received the Oertifieate of Instituthm, etc.‚ from Hugh de

Hikelynge, President of the Consistory Court, whom he had commissioned
to make Inquisition as to the vacaney, etc„ and to deal with the matter.
From the first few lines of his Letter which remain to ns, we find that
Torre had been presented to the Bishop by the Patrons, the Prior and Con-
vent of Plympt0n3 but, being engaged in the King’s affairs, and consequently
at a distance from his City and Diocese‚ he had decided to proceed by
Commissi0n‚ being anxious to spare the said William trouble and expense.
The Commissary was to act with the Archdeacon or his Official, not con-
vening the whole Chapter of the Deanery.
