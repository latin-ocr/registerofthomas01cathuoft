dentes 3 ab Ecclesiis ipsis, absque Licencia nostra seu aliqua causa racio-
nabili, se absentant et absentarunt, ac absentavit eorum uterque per tem-
pora, diuturna, Ecclesiarum hujusmodi et parochianorum suorum curam
et regimen temere deserendo; propter que in gregibus sibi commissis
vicia pululant, Divinus Cultus diminuitur, hospitalitas subtrahitur, et
edificia Beneficiorum suorum hujusmodi collabuntur, graviaque scandala
suscitantur, ac, prochdolor, anime parochianorum suorum, ad quorum
salutem ipsi spirituales medici deputantur, evidentibus periculis ex-
ponuntur.'' The Commissaries were to admonish the offenders to return
to their Benefices and submit to correction and punishment, which for

webbe complained to the Bishop, as Ordinary, that, having been, some

Vicars-ChoraL he had suffered much from the interference of Sir Roger
Prymer, the Sacristau, and Sir John Seyntdmeys, one of the Vicars, who
had nsurped, and continued to usurp, his parochial rights3 baptizing
infants without asking his leave, and visiting his siclt parishioners aud
hearing their confessions. The Sacristan had deprived him of the habit
which both he and his predecessors had always worn in the Choir, and
had taken away his rightful share in certain oblations and distributions.
He begged the Bishop to provide a remedy 3 and Uphulle was commissioned
to make inquiry, and do justice to the complainant if these charges were
proved—Data (sic).

if he found that the said Cemetery had been polluted as alleged, he was

to forbid all interments therein until it should have been reconciled.—
