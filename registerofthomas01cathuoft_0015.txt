 

PREFACE.

Tum Rmmmz of Bishop Thomas (lo Brantyngrham is compl-ised
in two folio Volumes, written on vellum. A few of the loaves in
both Volulnes, have been injured by (lampz hut, happily, it has
been found possible to read, or supply with certainty, every
(lamaged word.1 In other respects both Volumes are in an excellent
state of preservation throughout.

Volume 1 oontai11s2 the continuation from Volume II of the
“Registrum C‹‘›1nlnune.'⁴ which. except for the tlwft of. a— single
folio, is complete fron] the 5th of March, 1369-70, the date of
the Bull of Pope Urban the Fifth, to the. lssth of May, 1392, rather
more than two years and a half before the Bishop's death. The last
Entry, a long one. beginning on folio 2:31 ancl occupying the whole
ot* folio 2311), has been mutilated, through the loss of the succeeding
folios, and its date has consequently perishetl. This Volumex com
sists now, therefore, of 231 solim, nominally, hut, really, of 230,
folio 69 having been cut out. The writing· of the earlier folios
(1—48), though quite legible, is extremely poor and irregular, tho
work of several unskilful han‹1s; the remainder of. tho Volunw is,
with few exceptions, beautifully written.
