shews that this Institution was subsequent, by a few days, to the Ex-
change and Institution which occurred 16 June, when “Sir Nicbolas”
was inst. in the person of his Proetor, the said Sir John Hokere. William
Slade obtained Axmouth, and he was V. there till 2 Feb„ 1397-8, when he
became XVarden of Ottery Collegiate Church ; and ,John Hokere was R. of
Cotleigh when he exchanged for the Rectory of St. Michael’s, Bristol,
14 Oet„ 1402 (Biskop Stafford’s Reqistem pp. 143, 159). It will be ob-
served that Sir Nicholas simply disappears, though his Exchange was
authorized and Institution followed. See the Cotleigh and Axmouth
