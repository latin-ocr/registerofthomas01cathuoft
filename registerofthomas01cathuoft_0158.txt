Bishop Brantyngham died on the 23rd ot December, 1394, about three weeks
after the latest of these Entries. It is deeply to be regretted that his fine Register
of Institutione should have been marred by the shameful abstracting of several
folios3 a loss which is, of course, irreparable. It will be found, too, that, in
several places, room was reserved for Entrics which were never made. But, on
the whole, the record is fairly continuone and complete. I say “cont-inuous,” because
in nearly every instance the name of the predecessor, who had either resigned
his Benefiee or had died, is given, which was far from being the case in the
earlier Registers. And it will be found that some of the omitted Entries can be ⁷
supplied from the Register of Commissions, in which Institutione by Com-
missaries, after Inquisitions made on the spot, are duly recorded. There will,
therefore, be very little difficulty in compiling complete Lists of successive Incum-
bents, as far as their names are concerned, though in many cases the dates of
Institution have perishcd with the stolen folios.

“ Libera Capella de Mymbure '' (see p. 102, under ST. PROBUS). There has been
much difficulty in identifying this Benefice. There can be little doubt, however,
that the place meant is Imber, near Heytesbury, as Mr. Baigent suggests. See
Reyt'ster Wykeham, vol. ii fol. 409b.
