62.-—T0 Masters Hugh Hiclynge, Precentor of Crediton, and John de North-
wode‚ Sequestrator-General in Devon.—The Bishop had recently visited
Tavistock Abbey, and had arranged to deal with certain matters which
demanded reformation on the Wednesday next after the Feast of St.
Barnabas, but he was obliged to postpone the Visitation of the Abbey till
the Wednesday next after the Feast of St. James, and they were to
prorogue the Visitation accordingly.—Dated at East Horsley, 29 May.

63-—T0 Masters John Wyliot, Chaucellor of the Cathedml, and Hugh Hic-
lynge, Precentor of Crediton.—-Master william Bamptme, Canon of
Credston, had appeared before the Bishop, and assui-ed him that Canon
Henry Pyke had not died intestate, bnt had made his will, “ ut debuit '’;
it was duly scaled and witnessed ; there were many legacies, and he, the
said William, was named thei-ein as one of the Executors. He was him-
self present when the Will was made, and had promised to serve. After
testator's death, feeling some doubt as to the validity of the Will, he had
concluded that the administration of the effects of the deceased, as of a
man dying intestate, had lapsed to the Bishop. But he had recently
ascertained that he had been mistaken in this, as the witnesses, who still
survived, could prove; and he was afraid that, through his carelessness,
the testator would be wronged and the legatees prejudiced. Accordingly,
he besought the Bishop to intervene and sanction his fulfilling his duties
as an Executor. The Bishop, being absent from the Diocese, appointed
the above-named Commissaries to deal with the matter on his behalf,
requiring them to commit the execution of the Will, “prout decet,’'
to the said william and Sir Roger de Chestrefelde, R. of Ipplepen, re-
voking all previous Commissions (see No. 58).-Dated at Faringdon
(Hants), 30 June.

future unless the Bishop could protect them. He issued this Commissi0n‚
