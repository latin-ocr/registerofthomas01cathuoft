communicated for contumacy. He had allowed the Cliancel of St. Allen

155.--Το Brother Stephen, Prior of Launceston, and Master John Lugans,
R. of Petroekstowe.-The Bishop had recently visited ST. GERMAN'S
PRIORY, and had found many things which demanded correction, touching
which he had sent his Decree to the Prior and Conveni: ; but it had been
treated with contempt, the Prior and Canens being still guilty of lax
habits and immodest practices, neglecting the due observance and disci-
pline of their Rule ε they were as dissolute and unfaithful in the present,
as they had been 111 the past, to the peril of their 501115 and the detriment
of religion. This was more than the Bishop could tolerate, and he sent
his Commissaries to St. German's to make inquiries on the spot, and to
punish those whom they found guilty (not dated).
