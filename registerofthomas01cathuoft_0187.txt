175.——DAV1DSTOWE [Deustowe, MS.], V.——'Po Master John Lugans, Viear-

General in the Bishop's absence, and Master Roger Payn, President of
the Consistory Coum—Sir Thomas Bernarde, chaplain, had complained
that one Sir Baldwin Wylle, chaplain, had been intruded into the Vicarage
of DAVIDSTOWE by the patrous, the Master and Brethren of the Hospital
of St. John—the-Baptist at Bridgwater (to whom the Ohurch was appro-
priated), and held the Benefioe de flecta, not de jure2 the actual Vicar,
Sir Robert Knyyhte, being still alive. The said Baldwin, it was alleged,
had mendaciously reported to the Patrons that the Vicar was dead 3 and,
on their Presentation, Lugans, as Vicar-General, had admitted Baldwin
and instituted him, not knowing that the Benefice was full at the time
when the Presentation was made. Meanwhile the Vicar died, and the
Patrons, having discovered how flagrantly they had been deceived, re-
solved to expose the fraud, and presented to the Viearage, then really
vacant, Thomas Bernarde, the complainant. Baldwin, however, was not
so easily disposed of ; he was in possession and claimed to be the rightful
Vicar. Accordingly Bernarde appealed to the Bishop for a remedy 3 and
the above-named Commissaries were ordered to cite all persons concerned
to appear before them, and to institute complainant if it should be proved
that a fraud had been committed—Dama London, 24 Jan., 1385-6. [The
said Thomas Barnard (sic) died V. of Davidstow in March, 1407-8, · see
